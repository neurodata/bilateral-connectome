# Abstract 

Neuroscientists have many questions about connectomes that revolve around the ability to compare networks. For example, comparing connectomes could help explain how neural wiring is related to individual differences, genetics, disease, development, or learning. One such question is that of bilateral symmetry: are the left and right sides of a connectome the same? Here, we investigate the bilateral symmetry of a recently presented connectome of an insect brain, the Drosophila larva. We approach this question from the perspective of two-sample testing for networks. First, we show how this question of “sameness” can be framed as a variety of different statistical hypotheses, each with different assumptions. Then, we describe test procedures for each of these hypotheses. We show how these different test procedures perform on both the observed connectome as well as a suite of synthetic perturbations to the connectome. We also point out that these tests require careful attention to parameter alignment and differences in network density in order to provide biologically-meaningful results. Taken together, these results provide the first statistical characterization of bilateral symmetry for an entire brain at the single-neuron level, while also giving practical recommendations for future comparisons of connectome networks.
