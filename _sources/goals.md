# Goals

The goals of this paper are to: 
- Demonstrate how one can frame the question of bilateral symmetry (or other notions of
  comparing two networks) as a statistical hypothesis test
- Provide test procedures for each of the notions of bilateral symmetry above
- Explain the models and tests above in an intuitive way, even if the audience does not
  want to dive into the math
- Demonstrate how the results of these tests on real data are sensitive to these 
  modeling assumptions
- Demonstrate that each of these tests is more or less sensitive to particular
  alternatives to the null hypothesis they are testing
- Provide the first statistical characterization of bilateral symmetry for a whole-brain
