# Outline 

# Preliminaries
- In [](unmatched_vs_matched.ipynb) we briefly explain the difference between a matched
  and an unmatched pair of networks.
- In [](define_data.ipynb) we explain what data we'll use for our comparisons. 

# Unmatched Tests
- In [](er_unmatched_test.ipynb), we run a test for whether the Erdos-Renyi model
fits between the two hemispheres are similar, finding that they are significantly different 
even under this simple model.
- In [](sbm_unmatched_test.ipynb), we run a test for whether stochastic block model fits between the 
two hemispheres are similar. We also present a version for this test which accounts for
differences in edge density between the hemispheres. 
- In [](rdpg_unmatched_test.ipynb), we run a test for whether random dot product graph model fits
between the two hemispheres are similar. We find that in general, this test fails to 
reject the null hypothesis of bilateral symmetry, but that this analysis is highly 
sensitive to the choice of embedding dimension.s
- In (COMING SOON), we run each of these tests over perturbed versions of the left and
right connectomes to analyze their power under a variety of alternatives to our null
hypothesis of symmetry.

# Matched Tests
- In [](er_matched_test.ipynb), we again test for bilateral symmetry under the 
  Erdos-Renyi model, this time using the matched/known-node-correspondence data. Again, 
  we find that the two hemispheres are significantly different under this model.
- In [](sbm_matched_test.ipynb), we perform a test for stochastick block model fit
  symmetry using the matched data. Again, we find that the stochastic block model fits
  are significantly different, but when adjusting to correct for a difference in
  density, this difference disappears.

# Appendix
- [](nhypergeom_sims.ipynb) describes a modified Fisher's exact test, supporting some of the work in 
[](sbm_test.ipynb).
- (COMING SOON) closely examines the effect of embedding dimension on the test presented in [](rdpg_unmatched_test.ipynb), demonstrating that artificially low p-values can be the 
result of misaligned network embeddings caused by close eigenvalues. This highlights the
importance of carefully examining the embeddings and spectra when comparing networks
with this method, and also that overshooting the embedding dimension can be helpful to 
avoid this problem.
