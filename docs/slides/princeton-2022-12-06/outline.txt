we have this brain 
anatomy is helpful...
one way is by giving us some broad organizing cell types 
another way is by allowing us to define axon dendrite splits
wanted to understand potential flows of information through this network; how could use the different channels
we used x method to try to sort network from sensory to motor and in between, briefly explain
we compared amount of feedforward/feedback synapses in the different channels 
<some kind of segue?>
next, wanted to look at cell types based on connectivity
